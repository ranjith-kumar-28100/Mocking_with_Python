# Mocking in Python

This folder contains code related to mocking in Python using the `unittest.mock` module.

## Breakdown of the Code

### 1) Mock
- Practical example of creating a mock object using `Mock`.

### 2) configure_mock
- Example of using the `configure_mock` method to configure the mock object.

### 3) return_value
- Example of setting the `return_value` attribute of a mock object.

### 4) side_effect
- Example of using the `side_effect` attribute to define side effects for a mock object.

### 5) MagicMock
- Introduction to the `MagicMock` class and its capabilities.

### 6) assert_called()
- Example of using the `assert_called()` method to assert that the mock was called.

### 7) assert_not_called()
- Example of using the `assert_not_called()` method to assert that the mock was not called.

### 8) assert_called_with()
- Example of using the `assert_called_with()` method to assert the arguments with which the mock was called.

### 9) called
- Example of checking the `called` attribute to determine if the mock was called.

### 10) call_count
- Example of using the `call_count` attribute to count the number of calls to the mock.

### 11) mock_calls
- Example of using the `mock_calls` attribute to inspect the calls made to the mock.

### 12) spec (class and object)
- Example of using the `spec` attribute to set the spec of a mock object.

### 13) spec_set
- Example of using the `spec_set` attribute to restrict the spec of a mock object.

### 14) patch
- Introduction to the `patch` function for mocking objects in a module.

### 15) @patch
- Example of using the `@patch` decorator to mock objects in a module.
